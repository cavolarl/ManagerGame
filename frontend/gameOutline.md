# Spreadsheet Manager 2025 – Roguelike Run Structure

## Setup (Start of a Run / Quarter)

1. **Starting Budget**
   - Begin with a fixed amount (e.g., $50k).
   - Spend to recruit your initial employees.

2. **Generate Starting Contracts**
   - 2–3 randomly generated projects with:
     - **Difficulty:** easy / medium / hard
     - **Deadline:** short / medium / long
     - **Reward:** money + stakeholder value
     - **Risk:** chance of errors or failure if quality is too low

---

## Turn Structure (Each Week)

Each turn represents **one in-game week**. Players do the following:

1. **Assign Employees**
   - Allocate employees to projects.
   - Each employee contributes a number of **Work Points** based on their Speed.
   - Accuracy determines chance of errors (affects rewards or penalties).

2. **Pay Salaries & Overheads**
   - Deduct weekly salaries from budget.
   - Low budget → morale drops, risk of employees quitting increases.

3. **Weekly Event**
   - Draw a random event that can be:
     - **Positive:** morale boost, free resources
     - **Negative:** project delays, progress loss
     - **Strategic:** new hire opportunity, surprise project

4. **Progress Projects**
   - Update project progress based on assigned Work Points.
   - Completed projects grant rewards and possibly generate new contracts.

## End of Quarter (Boss Checkpoint)

At the end of each quarter (13 weeks? 1-2 weeks of vacation?):

- **Performance Review**
  - **Score = Stakeholder Value + Remaining Budget – Error Penalties**
  - Too low → game over (run ends).
  - Pass → advance to next quarter with harder projects.

- **Quarterly Upgrades**
  - Hire new employees
  - Train existing employees
  - Purchase office upgrades
  - Save money for future turns

## Stakeholder Value(Scoring System)

Each Quarter, you gain a choice of a few different contracts(projects)

- **Contracts**
  - Points (Based on difficulty)
  - Bonus Points (Quickness etc.)

- **Stakeholder Objectives**
  - Could be reducing workforce and keeping the same output
  - Could be completing more contracts
  - Could be getting a bad employee and keeping them employed until the end of the quarter

- **Error Penalties**
  - Points are deducted for incomplete contracts
  - But bonus points of those contracts are still valid

- **Remaining Budget**
  - Players are awarded a score multiplier for going under budget

---

## Meta-Progression (Between Runs)

This is not a focus right now. More for a feature sort of "prestige" system.

When a run ends (win or lose):

- **Permanent Unlocks**
  - New employee types (Data Scientist, Project Manager, etc.)
  - Company perks (better onboarding, cheaper training, morale bonuses)
  - New project types with higher risks/rewards
